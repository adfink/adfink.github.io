I've never been so good at describing myself.

This blog is an attempt to rectify that.  

I hope that by writing about what I do and think and learn, I will be able to bring
more coherence to this person I call me.

I'm also hoping that writing will help me to drill deeper on some of the topics that most interest me.
I've had this gnawing, back of the mind, deep in the gut sort of feeling for a while that I need to put more
work into developing my passions.  That I've lazily chosen breadth over depth, and that the time is long
over-due to become a man of depth.

That's what this blog is about.  Wish me luck!
