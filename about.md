### What's the point?

To point out some cool things, and hopefully through writing (and through the thinking that writing requires), discover even more cool things!  

Also to pollute the internet with more, largely meaningless, drivel.


### About who's writing this crap

# some of the raw materials

*Things I know about myself*

I'm 24.
I'm from Wisconsin.  
I live in the Bay Area.  
I like plants, and trees, and dirt paths, and big skies.
I like to rock climb.
I'm working on a master's degree in environmental engineering.

## I also know that my email address is...

[andrewfink8@gmail.com](mailto:andrewfink8@gmail.com)

## additional raw materials

*Things that I know about me*

I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavors.

*Things that I know about the world*

It's big and round and small and flat.

*Things that I think about the world*

I think there's something very good about life.
I think it's easy to forget that when stuck in traffic.


*this list is a work in progress*


I've never been so good at describing myself.

Maybe this blog will help rectify that. I hope it does.

I hope that by writing about what I do and think and learn, I will be able to bring
more coherence to this person I call me.  So I'll add to this as I go.
