## What's the point?

The point is to point out cool things, and hopefully by shining light on these cool things, to discover even more cool things!  

Also to pollute the internet with more, largely meaningless, drivel.

## these cool things. what are they?
something between a social butterfly and a bloodthirsty piranha.

We all have thoughts.  Things pop into our minds sometimes.  Usually
these things pop out of our minds just as fast.  They just poke in to say hello
and then wander off into the ether to bother someone else.  Sometimes it's fun to
grab onto these thoughts, these ideas, and take a closer look.  Roll them around,
poke them back, toss them around and introduce them to other ideas that you see floating around.
Sometimes it's fun to grab on to one of these mind pops and take them for a ride to
a place they haven't been before and see what they'll do.  Sometimes it's fun to let the
mind pops take you for a ride and have them introduce you to their friends.  Sometimes it's fun
to try to draw these mind pops and paint their mannerisms, they're interactions, their friends, enemies
jealosies guilts and dreams and distant cousins.  To pin them down just for a second to sketch their outline
before letting them go.  Sometimes it's fun to file these sketches and paintings away in a scrapbook and
arrange them with other mind pop sketches and stuff.   Sometimes it's fun to color outside the lines of these
sketches and fill in some extra details, to go off the script on a little riff of your own and invent some crazy, maybe cool, maybe just plain stupid useless stuff.  The funny thing is that mind pops love this shit.  They'll flock to this outside the line doodling like blood thirsty piranhas.  And when they come they'll reveal themselves to be nice and friendly bloodthirsty piranhas, social butterflies really.  In fact just about all them will be amenable to being sketched themselves and introduced to others and taken for rides.  The more honorable among them will feel the obligation to return the favor and take you and the other mind pops for rides to some of their favorite places to meet their friends and family, many of whom will like the idea of joining the party. And the whole process just keeps going.  Basically that's what this website is about.
