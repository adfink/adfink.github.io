Contemplation 1.9

The sun and stuff. So cool. Really *really*, *actually*, really, *suuuper* cool.

First off the sun. So shiny and bright. More than a million times the size of earth just sitting
there all thermonuclear-like throwing off heat and light galore,
making it rain energy all day and (ironically) all night.  Literally
smashing atoms together so hard that they stick.  All day all night for
billions of years.  Whoa.  Talk about putting the team on your back.  Thanks sun!
It's nuts, it really is crazy.
But's what's even more nuts is the other stuff, the stuff that the sun makes possible here on earth.  



We're that other stuff.  We are all collections of light.  Bundled, up densified, animated, blobs of
light that are suspended in this flux of light energy.  It feels trite but it's
true, at least partly true, and it's deserving of real consideration.  We are all collections of light.  Sounds like something my kindergarten teacher told me back in '95, and upon closer inspection she was right on the money, proving again that the nineties were indeed the glory days.  Let's consider.

The sun shines down on little 'ol earth, and
all over it are these green things called plants that literally soak up
the sunshine (thanks plants!).  They reach out and grab onto it, and bottle it up.  They jam
this stellar energy into the chemical bonds of sugars.  Then the rest of us
heterotroph chumps come along and eat it.  We get a kick out of biting into an
apple because our taste buds can feel the bottled up sunshine in the sweet
sugar.  Our body recognizes that when it gets a hold of sugar, it's just a few
easy steps away form uncorking that sunshine in cells throughout the body.  And
of course when that happens, when our bodies crack open those molecules and
break those chemical bonds, that are really just stored up sunshine, our super
clever cells are able to quick nab that sunlight before it gets away.  Our cells
grab onto it and harness it to make their own chemical bonds for any number of
purposes.  Just think about that for a good minute.  Follow the chain of
causation from nuclear furnace, through 93 million miles of space, into a leaf,
into a molecule, into a mouth, into another molecule.  Imagine the trails of
light going from one place to another, tying everything up, connecting
it all.  Imagine the pool party going on right now in the aqueous soup of
each one of your 40 trillion cells as they uncork bottle after bottle of sunshine
passing the energy around. It's totally wild to think about.  If you give it
enough time, if you sit with it for a while and imagine it, it's pure wonder.
I think it's good to keep these little nuggets of amazement close at hand,
because for one it's fun to think about, but also I believe that on some level
we are really truly meant to perceive and to contemplate these things.  In some
way we are the universe's attempt at self-reflection.  

We are all collections of light. The plants that grow, grow off of collecting light, holding on to it, bundling it into chemical bonds and pushing it around. All life derives from these light bundles, all life is really a bundle of these bundles caught in a net, the light giving it shape and buoyancy, bumping jostling escaping and being caught again by another net. Until the net gets worn out, the spaces too big to hold the light bundles in... The light escapes, the net empties, it becomes limp, falls to the ground ... and then what?

Now of course not all life derives from light energy.  There's those bad-ass worms and shit at the bottom of the ocean raising the middle finger to the system by subsisting off of energy from sulphuric vents.  They're the hipsters on the tree of life proving that there's always a different way of doing things.  But just like most hipster things, everyone knows it's really not that cool.  No one actually wants to live on the bottom of the ocean eating dirt.  I much prefer getting my energy beamed to me through space at light speed then conveniently packaged for me by Mr. Jolly Green Giant et al.  

Sun, energy, the food-web, life.  So many cool things to think about.
