Thoughts for beginning.

This website will serve as a repository for all sorts of **ideas, thoughts, questions, information, ect**.
The intention here is to pass more of my life through a finer filter in order to bump up the coherence a few notches.

The primary objective is to generate a habit of *thoughtful reflection*. Putting it into writing is a way to make that habit more tangible and to increase the quality of my filtering.

Basically this is an attempt to get more organized, more purposeful, and more rigorous with the way I perceive and react to the things around me.
