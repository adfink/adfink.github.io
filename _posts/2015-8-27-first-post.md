In the beginning was the word...
--------------------------------

This website will serve as a repository for all sorts of **ideas, thoughts, questions, information, ect**.
The intention here is to pass more of my life through a finer filter in order to bump up the coherence a few notches.
Writing is that filter.
If people feel like reading these things, cool.... if not cool.

The primary objective is to generate a habit of *thoughtful reflection*. Putting it out on a blog is a way to make me care more about the quality of my filtering and hopefully it's a way to increase my commitment to the whole endeavor itself.
I'm hoping to get more organized, more purposeful, more accountable to myself.  All good intentions right?  I've had all these intentions before but lacked in the follow-through department.

Time will tell if this attempt is any different.
